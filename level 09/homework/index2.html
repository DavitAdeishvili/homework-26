<h1>Programming languages</h1>
<h2>Python</h2>
<p>Python is a dynamic high-level programming language with a wide range of features, designed with a focus on easy code readability. </p>
<p>The Python standard library is large and versatile. It uses very rare separators for blocks - paragraphs.</p>

<h2>Java</h2>
<p> Java is a general-purpose, concurrent, object-oriented programming language. </p>
<p>Java is a strongly typed language. It is syntactically similar to the earlier languages â€‹C and C++. </p>

<h2>Ruby</h2>
<p>Ruby is a high-level dynamic object-oriented programming language. </p>
   <p> He gained special popularity after creating the web programming framework - "Rails".</p>
    <p>Ruby's core paradigm is class-based object-oriented programming with a message-passing mechanism.</p>
